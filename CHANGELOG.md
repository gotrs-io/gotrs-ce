# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project (currently) does not yet use semantic versioning; versions will be tagged once the ticket vertical slice lands.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-01-08

### Added
- **AVIF/HEIC Thumbnail Support**: Thumbnail service now supports AVIF and HEIC image formats via govips/libvips; Dockerfile.toolbox updated with required vips packages for CGO compilation
- **Thumbnail Service Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for `IsSupportedImageType`, `calculateThumbnailScale`, `GetPlaceholderThumbnail`, `DefaultThumbnailOptions`
- **Note Attachment Support**: Notes can now include file attachments; form uses `multipart/form-data` encoding and backend processes uploads after article creation
- **Enhanced Attachment Viewer**: Inline attachment viewer redesigned with:
  - Close button (primary color, dark mode compatible) with Esc key support
  - Collapsible metadata panel showing filename, type, size, upload date, attachment ID
  - Download button in header bar
  - Eye icon for view action (replaces ambiguous video icon)
  - Clicking attachment filename opens inline viewer by default (previously downloaded)
- **Version Display on Login**: Build version shown at bottom of agent login page; displays semantic version tag or branch name with short git commit hash in parentheses
- **Build Version Injection**: New `internal/version` package with ldflags injection; Makefile extracts git tag/branch/commit at build time and injects via `-X` flags; all build targets updated
- **SQL Portability Guard**: New `scripts/tools/check-sql.sh` script validates SQL queries for cross-database compatibility, blocking commits with PostgreSQL-specific `$N` placeholders or `ILIKE` operators
- **Helm Chart**: Production-ready Kubernetes deployment via `charts/gotrs/` with OCI registry publishing
  - Tag-mirroring: Chart `appVersion` matches git ref for GitOps workflows; `--version main` deploys `:main` images, `--version v0.5.0` deploys `:v0.5.0` images
  - Database selection: MySQL (default) or PostgreSQL via `database.type: mysql|postgresql` with custom StatefulSet templates
  - Valkey subchart: Official valkey-helm chart (BSD-3 licensed) as Redis-compatible cache dependency
  - extraResources: Arbitrary Kubernetes resources with full Helm templating support (`{{ .Release.Name }}`, `{{ .Values.* }}`, etc.)
  - Annotations and labels: Custom annotations/labels for cloud integrations (AWS IRSA, GKE Workload Identity, Prometheus scraping, Istio sidecar, AWS load balancers)
  - HPA support: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for backend with configurable min/max replicas and CPU/memory targets
  - Ingress configuration: Flexible ingress with TLS, custom annotations, and multi-host support
  - Security contexts: All deployments include `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `capabilities: drop: [ALL]`; database adds `runAsNonRoot`, `runAsUser: 999`, tmpfs for /tmp and /run/mysqld
  - CI integration: GitHub Actions publishes chart to `oci://ghcr.io/gotrs-io/charts/gotrs` on push to main or version tags
- **govulncheck Integration**: Go vulnerability scanning included in toolbox and security scans via `make scan-vulnerabilities`
- **Trivy Ignore File**: `.trivyignore` for configuring security scanner exclusions
- **Trivy Cache Persistence**: Trivy vulnerability database cached in `gotrs_cache` volume at `/cache/trivy`; eliminates re-download on every scan
- **Tool Cache Consolidation**: All standalone container tools now use `gotrs_cache` volume: golangci-lint (`/cache/golangci-lint`), Redocly/bun (`/cache/bun`), css-watch
- **Toolbox Entrypoint Script**: `scripts/toolbox-entrypoint.sh` for cache permission validation

### Changed
- **Attachment Click Behavior**: Clicking attachment filename now opens inline viewer instead of triggering download; download available via dedicated button
- **Attachment List Icons**: View button changed from video/play icon to eye icon for clearer UX
- **SQL Portability (MySQL/PostgreSQL)**: Comprehensive refactor of ~1,800 SQL queries across 127 files for cross-database compatibility
  - Converted all PostgreSQL-specific `$N` placeholders to portable `?` format with `database.ConvertPlaceholders()` wrapper
  - Replaced all `ILIKE` operators with `LOWER(column) LIKE LOWER(?)` for case-insensitive search portability
  - Updated repositories: ticket, article, user, queue, group, priority, state, permission, email_account, email_template, time_accounting
  - Updated API handlers: admin modules (users, groups, queues, priorities, states, types, roles, services, SLAs, customer companies/users), agent handlers, customer portal handlers
  - Updated components: dynamic field handlers, base CRUD handlers
  - All queries now use `database.GetAdapter().InsertWithReturning()` for portable INSERT operations with ID retrieval
- **Bun Package Manager Migration**: Replaced npm with bun for faster frontend builds and cleaner host filesystem
  - Dockerfile frontend stage uses `oven/bun:1.1-alpine` with Node.js for build tool compatibility
  - All `npm`/`npx` commands replaced with `bun`/`bunx` in Makefile and package.json scripts
  - Removed `package-lock.json`, now using `bun.lockb` binary lockfile
  - `make build` no longer runs frontend-build on host; Dockerfile handles CSS/JS build entirely
  - No `node_modules` directory created on host during builds
  - Bun global cache at `/cache/bun` in toolbox container
- **Go Version Single Source of Truth**: Go version centralized in `.env` as `GO_IMAGE` variable; all Dockerfiles, scripts, and Makefile targets inherit from this setting
- **Go Toolchain Upgrade**: Upgraded to Go 1.24.11 with toolchain directive in go.mod
- **Named Volume for Cache**: Changed `CACHE_USE_VOLUMES` default from `0` to `1`; development uses named Docker volume `gotrs_cache` instead of host bind mounts
- **Dockerfile.toolbox Simplified**: Removed complex entrypoint script, su-exec dependency, and USER root; container runs directly as `appuser` (UID 1000)
- **Dockerfile.playwright-go Security**: Creates and runs as non-root user `pwuser` with proper cache directory ownership
- **Production Reverse Proxy**: Replaced nginx with Caddy in `docker-compose.prod.yml`; Caddy provides automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt with embedded Caddyfile configuration
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated `golang.org/x/crypto`, `golang.org/x/net`, `golang.org/x/text`, `golang.org/x/sys`, and MCP SDK dependencies

### Security
- **Bun Installation Security**: Replaced insecure `curl|bash` Bun installation in Dockerfile.toolbox with GPG-verified tarball download; verifies signature against official Bun signing key before extraction
- **SDK Dependency Updates** (`sdk/go/go.mod`): Updated `github.com/go-resty/resty/v2` v2.10.0 → v2.16.5 (fixes HTTP request body disclosure), `golang.org/x/net` v0.17.0 → v0.34.0 (fixes XSS, IPv6 proxy bypass, header DoS vulnerabilities)
- **CVE-2023-36308 Mitigation**: Added panic recovery to `ThumbnailService.GenerateThumbnail` to gracefully handle crafted TIFF files that could cause server panic; no upstream patch available for `disintegration/imaging`

### Fixed
- **deleteAttachment JavaScript Error**: Added missing `deleteAttachment` function to ticket detail template; was called from HTMX-rendered attachment list but never defined
- **Note Content Field Not Found**: Fixed note form submission looking for wrong element ID (`note_content` instead of `body` used by rich text editor)
- **Note Form Null Errors**: Fixed `ensureErrorDiv` and `htmx.trigger` null reference errors by using correct element IDs and removing invalid element references
- **API Empty Response on Auth Failure**: Auth middleware now returns JSON 401 instead of HTML redirect when `Accept: application/json` header is present; `apiFetch()` helper automatically sets this header for all API calls
- **Direct fetch() API Calls**: Replaced 10 direct `fetch()` calls across 5 templates (profile, priorities, queues, dynamic_module, tickets) with `apiFetch()` to ensure proper Accept header and error handling
- **Thumbnail URL Generation**: Fixed broken thumbnail URLs in `ticket_messages_handler.go`; was generating `/api/attachments/:id/thumbnail` (non-existent route) instead of correct `/api/tickets/:id/attachments/:attachment_id/thumbnail`
- **History Recording Interface Mismatch**: Fixed `TicketRepository.AddTicketHistoryEntry` method signature to match `history.HistoryInserter` interface; changed `exec ExecContext` parameter to `exec interface{}` to enable proper type assertion in history recorder
- **SQL Argument Order Bugs**: Fixed argument order in `handleDeleteQueue` and `handleDeleteType` where `change_by` and `id` parameters were swapped
- **Missing SQL Arguments**: Fixed `insertArticle`, `insertArticleMimeData`, and `HandleRegisterWebhookAPI` missing `change_by` argument for MySQL NOT NULL columns
- **LOWER() Format String Typo**: Fixed `%LOWER(s)` typo in `base_crud.go` search query builder (should be `LOWER(%s)`)
- **Test Database Isolation**: Removed `defer db.Close()` calls from 7 test files that were closing the singleton database connection, causing "sql: database is closed" errors in subsequent tests
- **Makefile Toolbox Environment**: Added missing `TEST_DB_NAME`, `TEST_DB_USER`, `TEST_DB_PASSWORD` environment variables to 5 toolbox targets; fixed `TEST_DB_HOST`/`TEST_DB_PORT` to use `TOOLBOX_TEST_DB_HOST`/`TOOLBOX_TEST_DB_PORT` for host network mode
- **MariaDB Init Script**: Fixed `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON otrs.* TO 'otrs'@'localhost'` error on fresh installs; `%` wildcard already covers localhost connections so removed redundant localhost grant
- **MariaDB Port Exposure**: Database port 3306 now exposed for host-based tools and MCP MySQL server access
- **Password Reset Modal**: Fixed JavaScript error when password reset API call fails
- **Gitignore Exception**: Added `!charts/gotrs/templates/secrets/` to prevent Helm secret templates from being ignored
- **Gitleaks Binary Allowlist**: Added `bun.lockb` to `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist; binary lockfile contains no secrets

### Removed
- **Legacy Kustomize Manifests**: Removed entire `k8s/` directory (22 files); Kubernetes deployments now use Helm chart at `charts/gotrs/`
- **Bare Metal Deployment**: Removed `docs/deployment/bare-metal.md` and all references; GOTRS supports containerized deployment only (Docker/Podman)
- **Nginx Configuration**: Removed `docker/nginx/` directory (Dockerfile, nginx.conf, error.html, entrypoint.sh); production deployments now use Caddy
- **DATABASE_URL Environment Variable**: Removed from compose files; use individual `DB_*` variables instead

### Documentation

- **Demo Rate Limiting**: Updated from nginx to Caddyfile format
- **Schema Discovery**: Updated to reference `GO_IMAGE` environment variable

### Internal
- **Auth Middleware Tests**: Added 3 tests for `unauthorizedResponse` Accept header behavior verifying JSON vs HTML redirect based on Accept header
- **Note Attachment Test**: Added `TestTicketNoteWithAttachment` integration test with multipart form handling
- All Dockerfiles now accept `GO_IMAGE` build arg with consistent defaults
- Build targets (`make build`, `make build-cached`, etc.) pass `GO_IMAGE` and version build args to container builds
- Test and API scripts updated to use `GO_IMAGE` environment variable
- OpenAPI spec cleaned up (removed duplicate localhost:8000 server entry)
- Test suite now passes 876 tests with proper database isolation and MySQL compatibility
- SQL portability guard integrated into development workflow via check-sql.sh script

- Database schema support for storing email threading headers in article records.
- Integration with agent ticket routes to include threading headers in customer notifications.
- Outbound customer notifications now send threaded emails on ticket creation and public replies, persisting Message-ID/In-Reply-To/References for future responses.
- Unit coverage for mailqueue threading helpers (Message-ID generation, threading headers, extraction) to guard regressions.
- Completed ticket creation vertical slice: `/api/tickets` service handler, HTMX agent form, attachment/time accounting support, and history recorder coverage.
- Ticket zoom (`pages/ticket_detail.pongo2`) now renders live articles, history, and customer context for newly created tickets.
- Status transitions, agent assignment, and queue transfer endpoints wired for both HTMX and JSON flows with history logging.
- Agent Ticket Zoom tabs now render ticket history and linked tickets via Pongo2 HTMX fragments, providing empty-state messaging until data exists.
- MySQL test container now applies the same integration fixtures as PostgreSQL, so API suites run identically across drivers.
- Regression coverage for `/admin/users` and YAML fallback routes when `GOTRS_DISABLE_TEST_AUTH_BYPASS` is disabled.
- **Admin Services Module**: Full CRUD functionality with 31 unit tests covering page rendering, create (form+JSON), update, delete, validation, DB integration, JSON responses, HTMX responses, and content-type handling.
- **Admin Customer User Services**: New management page at `/admin/customer-user-services` for assigning services to individual customer users, with dual-view UI (customer→services and service→customers).
- **Service Filtering in Customer Portal**: Customer ticket creation form now filters services to only show those assigned to the logged-in customer user via `service_customer_user` table.
- **Service Field in Agent Ticket Form**: Agents can now select a Service when creating tickets, with the service_id saved to the ticket record.
- **Default Services for Customer Users**: Customer users can now have default services assigned that are automatically pre-selected when creating tickets via the customer portal.
- **Dynamic Fields Admin Module**: Full CRUD for dynamic field definitions with 7 field types (Text, TextArea, Dropdown, Multiselect, Checkbox, Date, DateTime).

- Documentation updated for inbound email IMAP aliases, folder metadata, and integration coverage notes.

### Fixed
- **CI Workflow Failures**: Rewrote security.yml and build.yml workflows that referenced non-existent files (Dockerfile.dev, Dockerfile.frontend, web/ directory). Project is a monolithic Go+HTMX app, not separate frontend/backend.
- **golangci-lint v1.64+ Compatibility**: Updated .golangci.yml to use `issues.exclude-dirs` instead of deprecated `run.skip-dirs`, removed other deprecated options.
- **Coverage Generation in CI**: Added git safe.directory configuration and GOFLAGS for VCS stamping to fix coverage generation in containerized CI environment.
- **Customer User Typeahead JSON Escaping**: Fixed JSON parsing issues in customer user autocomplete seed data where HTML entities (e.g., `&amp;`) were causing parse errors. Added `|escapejs` filter to properly escape strings for JSON context.
- **Admin Navigation Bar**: Fixed navigation showing customer portal links on admin pages (e.g., `/admin/customer/companies/*/edit`) when `PortalConfig` was passed for portal settings tab. Added `isAdmin` flag check in `base.pongo2` to prevent `isCustomer` detection on admin pages.
- SLA admin update handler now converts PostgreSQL placeholders to MySQL (`ConvertPlaceholders`).
- SLA admin create handler properly handles NOT NULL columns by converting nil to 0.
- Admin customer company create now returns validation (400) instead of 404 for POST to `/customer/companies/new`.
- Database connectivity issues in test environments with proper network configuration for test containers.
- Auth middleware, YAML fallback guards, and legacy route middleware now respect `GOTRS_DISABLE_TEST_AUTH_BYPASS`, preventing unauthenticated access to admin surfaces during regression runs.
- SQL placeholder conversion issues for MySQL compatibility in user and group repositories.
- User title field length validation to prevent varchar(50) constraint violations.
- Admin groups overview now renders the `comments` column so descriptions entered in Znuny/OTRS appear in the group list UI.
- Admin groups membership links now launch the modal and load data through `/members`, restoring the key icon and member count actions.

- SLA admin routes added to `routes/admin.yaml` for YAML-driven routing consistency.
- User repository Create and Update methods now include title length validation and proper SQL placeholder conversion.
- Group repository queries now use database.ConvertPlaceholders for cross-database compatibility.

### Removed
- _Nothing yet._

### Breaking Changes
- _None._

### Internal / Developer Notes
- Track follow-up work for status/assignment transitions and SMTP mail-sink container integration.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-20
### Added
- Generic GoatKit Typeahead enhancement (`goatkit-typeahead.js`): Enter/Tab auto-selects first suggestion, prevents accidental form submission, advances focus.
- GoatKit Autocomplete module (`goatkit-autocomplete.js`): declarative data-attribute driven autocomplete (seed JSON + future remote source), ARIA roles (combobox/listbox/option), keyboard navigation, first-item auto-highlight.
- Visual commit feedback (flash outline) on auto-complete commit.
- Global guards to prevent duplicate script initialization.
- Data seed loader with tolerant JSON parsing (trailing comma removal) and inline `<script type="application/json" data-gk-seed>` support.
- Hidden input synchronization via `data-hidden-target` for canonical value submission.
- Blur + click-outside handling to close suggestion lists.
- Configurable min character threshold (`data-min-chars`, default 1).
- Debug gating via `window.GK_DEBUG` flag (suppressed logs by default).
- Ticket zoom page base template.
- Per-queue ticket stats table (dashboard) and admin dashboard deduplication.
- Redis (Valkey-compatible) caching layer abstraction.
- Article storage backend (DB + filesystem) integration.
- Evidence diff utility for TDD enforcement.
- Unified ticket number generator framework + counter migration.
- Pluggable auth provider registry (database, ldap, static) with tests.
- Dockerfile/dev compose improvements for caching & user customization.
- Comprehensive ticket creation & validation test suite.
- Agent ticket creation auto-selects preferred queues pulled from customer and customer-user group permissions, with info panel surfacing the resolved queue name.
- Playwright acceptance harness (`test-acceptance-playwright`) with queue preference coverage, configurable artifact directories, and resilient base URL resolution.
- Consolidated schema alignment with Znuny: added `ticket_number_counter`, surrogate primary key for `acl_sync`, `acl_ticket_attribute_relations`, `activity`, `article_color`, `permission_groups`, `translation`, `calendar_appointment_plugin`, `pm_process_preferences`, `smime_keys`, `oauth2_token_config`/`oauth2_token`, and `mention` tables via migration `000001_schema_alignment`.

### Changed
- Refactored customer user inline autocomplete logic on ticket creation form to generic GoatKit modules (removal of large inline JS block in `templates/pages/tickets/new.pongo2`).
- Display template placeholder format switched to single-brace form `{firstName}` to avoid template engine collision; template compiler now supports both `{{key}}` and `{key}`.
- Auth handlers adapted to new provider registry API.
- Ticket creation now relies on repository ticket number generator (post framework introduction).
- Dockerfile optimized for builds (layer caching / user customization notes).
- Activity stream handling cleaned (duplicate handlers removed).
- Added surrogate primary key to `acl_sync` as part of consolidated migration `000001_schema_alignment` to stay aligned with Znuny upstream schema.
- Ticket list + queue detail defaults to `not_closed`, populating status dropdowns from live state tables and excluding closed types when requested.
- Login screen auto-focuses and selects the username field on load for quicker keyboard entry.
- Coverage targets (`make test-coverage*`) now run through the toolbox inside containers, spin up DB/cache services, and delegate execution to `scripts/run_coverage.sh` for filtered package selection.

### Fixed
- Trailing comma in generated seed JSON causing parse error (replaced incorrect loop variable usage and added tolerant parser).
- Auto-commit path previously populating hidden field with display string instead of login (added `data-login` / `data-value` attributes to suggestion options).
- MutationObserver early attachment errors (guarded until `document.body` present in both typeahead and autocomplete scripts).
- Empty dropdown lingering after selection (added blur close + explicit hide on commit).
- Initial absence of suggestions due to seed load ordering (added pre-load of all seed scripts before initialization).
- Ticket number StartFrom honored via proper counter initialization.
- Premature return in activity stream handler.
- Build handler duplication causing symbol redeclaration.
- Toolbox build/test hanging issues (interactive shell hang & GOFLAGS parsing) resolved.

### Removed
- Unnecessary `console.debug` noise (now gated behind `window.GK_DEBUG`).

### Breaking Changes
- Auth initialization now requires explicit provider registration (auth provider registry).
- New DB migration `000001_schema_alignment` required before further ticket creation.

### Internal / Developer Notes
- Autocomplete registry kept in-memory (`REGISTRY`) for potential future API exposure.
- Future enhancements (not yet implemented): remote data source (`data-source`), match substring highlighting, customizable "No results" template, hot reload of seeds.
