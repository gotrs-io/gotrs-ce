# Static Routes Baseline - Last updated: Dec 29 2025
#
# Purpose: Prevent reintroduction of hard-coded routes. All business/API routes
# must live in YAML route files (routes/*.yaml).
#
# Migration Complete - All business routes now in YAML:
# - routes/api-tickets.yaml (ticket CRUD, search, merge)
# - routes/api-dashboard.yaml (dashboard widgets)
# - routes/api-queues.yaml (queue management)
# - routes/api-groups.yaml (group management)
# - routes/api-types.yaml (ticket type CRUD)
# - routes/api-canned-responses.yaml (canned responses)
# - routes/api-files.yaml (file serving)
# - routes/api-customers.yaml (customer search)
#
# Do NOT add new entries here. All new routes go in YAML files.
#
# No static business routes remaining.
