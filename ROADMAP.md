# GOTRS Development Roadmap

*Last updated: December 24, 2025 (evening)*

## 🚀 Current Status

**Version**: Pre-release (targeting 0.5.0 MVP on January 18, 2026)

GOTRS is a modern, open-source ticketing system built with Go and HTMX, designed as an OTRS-compatible replacement. The core ticketing functionality is complete, and we're in the final stabilization phase before MVP release.

### What Works Today
- ✅ **Agent Interface**: Full ticket management (create, view, update, assign, transfer)
- ✅ **Customer Portal**: Login, ticket submission, viewing, replies, and closure
- ✅ **Email Integration**: Inbound (POP3/IMAP) and outbound with RFC-compliant threading
- ✅ **Database**: Full MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL compatibility
- ✅ **Search**: Ticket search by number or title with pagination
- ✅ **Queue Management**: Real-time statistics and ticket filtering

### What's Missing for MVP
- ⏳ 48-hour stability burn-in test
- ⏳ Staging environment deployment
