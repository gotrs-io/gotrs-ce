# Static Routes Baseline
#
# This file is auto-created by scripts/validate_routes.sh the first time
# code-defined (non-YAML) business routes are detected in htmx_routes.go.
#
# Purpose: Prevent reintroduction or growth of hard-coded routes. All
# business/API routes must live in YAML route files. Only keep /health,
# /static assets and minimal bootstrap in code.
#
# Migration Workflow:
# 1. Move a code route to YAML.
# 2. Remove it from htmx_routes.go.
# 3. Regenerate: make build (script will show no new code routes).
# 4. Manually edit this baseline to delete the moved path.
# 5. Commit changes.
#
# Do NOT add new entries here unless absolutely necessary and temporary.

# ---- TEMPORARY ACCEPTED CODE-DEFINED ROUTES (Oct 4 2025) ----
# These were detected by validate_routes during make build. They MUST be
# migrated into YAML route definitions and then removed from this list.
# Grouped by feature. Do not expand this list further; only shrink it.
