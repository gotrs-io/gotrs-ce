## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker with Compose plugin OR Docker Compose standalone OR Podman with Compose
- Git
- 4GB RAM minimum
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

**Container Runtime Support:**
- ✅ Docker with `docker compose` plugin (v2) - Recommended
- ✅ `docker-compose` standalone (v1) - Legacy support
- ✅ Podman with `podman compose` plugin
- ✅ `podman-compose` standalone
- ✅ Full rootless container support
- ✅ SELinux labels configured for Fedora/RHEL systems

### Using Containers (Auto-detected)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gotrs-io/gotrs-ce.git
cd gotrs-ce

# Set up environment variables (REQUIRED - containers won't start without this!)
cp .env.development .env    # For local development (includes safe demo credentials)
# OR for production:
cp .env.example .env        # Then edit ALL values before use

# Start all services (auto-detects docker/podman compose command)
make up

# Alternative methods:
./scripts/compose.sh up          # Auto-detect wrapper script
docker compose up        # Modern Docker
docker-compose up        # Legacy Docker
podman compose up        # Podman plugin
podman-compose up        # Podman standalone

# Check which commands are available on your system
make debug-env

# Services will be available at:
# - Frontend: http://localhost
# - Backend API: http://localhost/api
# - smtp4dev (email sandbox): http://localhost:8025
# - Adminer (database UI): http://localhost:8090 (optional)

```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start services in background
make up-d

# View logs
make backend-logs

# Run database migrations
make db-migrate

# Stop services
make down

# Reset everything (including database)
make clean
```

### Podman on Fedora Kinoite/Silverblue

```bash
# Install podman-compose if needed
sudo rpm-ostree install podman-compose

# The Makefile auto-detects podman
make up

# Generate systemd units (Podman only)
make podman-systemd
```

### Demo Instance

Try GOTRS without installation at [https://try.gotrs.io](https://try.gotrs.io)

Demo credentials are shown on the demo instance login page.

*Note: Demo data resets daily at 2 AM UTC*

### Testing

GOTRS has comprehensive test coverage across multiple layers:

```bash
# Fast unit/integration tests (Alpine toolbox, ~30s)
make toolbox-test

# Full browser E2E tests (Ubuntu + Chromium, ~5min)
make test-e2e-playwright-go
```

Browser tests use Go + Playwright with the `//go:build playwright` tag and run in a dedicated Ubuntu container with Chromium. This separation keeps developer feedback fast while maintaining thorough browser coverage.

## Architecture

GOTRS uses a modern, hypermedia-driven architecture that scales from single-server deployments to large enterprise clusters:

- **Core Services**: Authentication, Tickets, Users, Notifications, Workflow Engine
- **Data Layer**: MariaDB/MySQL (default) or PostgreSQL, Valkey (cache), Zinc (search), S3-compatible storage (attachments)
- **API**: RESTful JSON APIs with HTMX hypermedia endpoints
- **Frontend**: HTMX + Alpine.js for progressive enhancement with Tailwind CSS
- **Workflow Engine**: Temporal for complex business processes and automation
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live updates
- **Search**: Zinc with Elasticsearch compatibility for full-text search

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical documentation.

### Pluggable Authentication

Authentication supports an ordered provider list configured via the `Auth::Providers` setting in `Config.yaml` (default: `[database]`). Implemented providers:

- `database` (agents + customer users from the database)
- `ldap` (optional; enable with environment variables `LDAP_ENABLED=true` and related LDAP settings)
- `static` (in-memory users for demos/tests)

Static users are enabled by setting the environment variable `GOTRS_STATIC_USERS` at runtime (NOT committed). Format:

```
GOTRS_STATIC_USERS="alice:password:Agent,bob:secret:Customer,carol:adminpass:Admin"
```

Notes:
- Do not add this variable (or sample secrets) to committed `.env` files to avoid GitLeaks false positives.
- Passwords may be plain or pre-hashed (bcrypt / legacy SHA from OTRS). The verifier auto-detects.
- Omit the variable entirely to disable the static provider silently.

Provider resolution order: the system attempts each provider in the configured list until one authenticates or all fail.

Implementation note: the `Auth::Providers` list is read at startup via the unified configuration adapter; the main process wires this adapter into the auth service so changes to the list (after a restart) alter provider selection order without code changes.

### Development Policies

- Database access: This project uses `database/sql` with a thin `database.ConvertPlaceholders` wrapper to support PostgreSQL and MySQL. All SQL must be wrapped. See `DATABASE_ACCESS_PATTERNS.md`.
- Templating: Use Pongo2 templates exclusively. Do not use Go's `html/template`. Render user-facing views via Pongo2 with `layouts/base.pongo2` and proper context.
- Routing: Define all HTTP routes in YAML under `routes/*.yaml` using the YAML router. Do not register routes directly in Go code.
  - YAML is the single source of truth for routes; hardcoded Gin registrations are prohibited.
  - Health endpoints (including `/healthz`) are declared in YAML. Static files are served via YAML using `handleStaticFiles`.
  - In test mode (`APP_ENV=test`), legacy admin hardcoded routes are skipped so SSR/YAML tests don’t double-register paths.
  - YAML route loader is idempotent in dev/tests: it skips registering a route if the same method+path already exists and logs a dedupe message to avoid Gin panics.

### SSR Smoke Tests

- The SSR smoke test discovers GET routes with templates from YAML and ensures they render without 5xx errors.
- Non-strict by default: logs 5xx; to fail on 5xx and on invalid/missing YAML-referenced templates, set `SSR_SMOKE_STRICT=1`.

## CI/CD & Quality

GOTRS maintains high code quality and security standards through comprehensive automated testing:

### 🔒 Security Pipeline
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Go (`govulncheck`), NPM dependencies (`npm audit`), container images (Trivy)
- **Static Analysis**: Security (gosec, Semgrep), code quality (golangci-lint, ESLint)
- **Secret Detection**: GitLeaks scans for accidentally committed secrets
- **License Compliance**: Automated license checking for all dependencies
- **SAST**: GitHub CodeQL for comprehensive static application security testing

### 🧪 Testing Pipeline  
- **Unit Tests**: Go backend with race detection, HTMX frontend
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end API testing with test database
- **Coverage**: Automated coverage reporting via Codecov
- **Database**: Full schema validation (MariaDB/PostgreSQL)

### 🚀 Build Pipeline
- **Multi-arch**: AMD64 and ARM64 container builds
- **Supply Chain Security**: SLSA Level 2 attestations, container signing
- **Automated Releases**: Tagged releases with comprehensive release notes
- **Manual Builds**: On-demand builds without registry pushing

### 📊 Quality Metrics
- All pipelines complete in under 10 minutes
- Zero-cost (GitHub Actions free tier + open source tools)

## Migration from OTRS

GOTRS maintains database schema compatibility with OTRS, enabling migration from existing installations. The `gotrs-migrate` tool handles database import from OTRS 5.x and 6.x SQL dumps.

```bash
# Analyze your OTRS dump
make migrate-analyze SQL=/path/to/otrs_dump.sql

# Test import (dry run)
make migrate-import SQL=/path/to/otrs_dump.sql DRY_RUN=true

# Execute import
make migrate-import SQL=/path/to/otrs_dump.sql DRY_RUN=false

# Validate migrated data
make migrate-validate
```

The migration tool imports tickets, articles, users, customers, queues, and configuration data. Article attachments require a separate filesystem copy.

See [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) for the complete migration guide.
