# GOTRS Roadmap

Current status, past releases, and future plans for GOTRS.

## 🚀 Current Status

**Version**: 0.6.5-dev (February 2026) - GoatKit Plugin Platform

GOTRS is a modern, open-source ticketing system built with Go and HTMX, designed as an OTRS-compatible replacement.

### What's New in 0.6.5-dev
See the [0.7.0 checklist](#070---target-may-2026) for detailed progress. Highlights:
- **Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)** — 2FA for agents and customers with QR setup, recovery codes, admin override
- **GoatKit Plugin Platform** — Dual-runtime (WASM + gRPC), HostAPI, admin UI, CLI tooling
- **API Tokens** — Personal access tokens for agents and customers
- **REST API v1 Enhanced** — OpenAPI 3.0, Swagger UI, rate limiting, webhooks
- **MCP Server** — AI assistant integration via JSON-RPC (`/api/mcp`) with multi-user proxy RBAC
- **Granular RBAC** — OTRS-compatible permission service with 1,300+ lines of auth tests
- **RBAC Security Hardening** — All statistics and queue endpoints now enforce queue-level permissions (prevents data leakage)

### What Works
- Agent Interface: Full ticket management with bulk actions and multi-theme UI (4 themes)
- Customer Portal: Complete self-service with profile management, password changes
- Email Integration: POP3/IMAP + RFC-compliant threading + auto-responses
- Database: MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL with cross-database compatibility
- Automation: GenericAgent, ACLs, SLA escalations, ticket attribute relations
- Integration: GenericInterface with REST/SOAP transports, webservice dynamic fields
- Security: Group-based queue permissions, session management, auth middleware, **API tokens**, **RBAC-filtered statistics**, **Two-factor authentication (TOTP)**
- i18n: 15 languages including RTL support (ar, he, fa, ur)
- Deployment: Docker Compose and Kubernetes Helm chart with multi-arch support
- Admin Modules: 30+ admin interfaces including ticket attribute relations, dynamic fields, templates
- **Plugins**: Dual-runtime (WASM + gRPC) plugin system with admin UI and state persistence
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 spec with Swagger UI (94 endpoints, 71% coverage)
- **RBAC**: Granular permission service with authorization tests
