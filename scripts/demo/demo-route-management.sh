📊 Route Performance Profile
===========================

Top 10 Slowest Routes (by P95 latency):
----------------------------------------
GET:/api/v1/tickets/search      P95: 892ms  Avg: 342ms  Count: 1,245
POST:/api/v1/tickets            P95: 543ms  Avg: 198ms  Count: 3,421
GET:/api/v1/customers/:id       P95: 421ms  Avg: 156ms  Count: 8,765
PUT:/api/v1/tickets/:id         P95: 398ms  Avg: 142ms  Count: 2,156
GET:/api/v1/reports/dashboard   P95: 367ms  Avg: 198ms  Count: 567
POST:/api/v1/tickets/:id/reply  P95: 334ms  Avg: 121ms  Count: 4,532
GET:/api/v1/kb/search           P95: 298ms  Avg: 98ms   Count: 12,456
DELETE:/api/v1/tickets/:id      P95: 276ms  Avg: 87ms   Count: 234
GET:/api/v1/queues/:id/tickets  P95: 243ms  Avg: 76ms   Count: 6,789
GET:/health                     P95: 8ms    Avg: 3ms    Count: 145,234

Performance Recommendations:
---------------------------
🔍 GET:/api/v1/tickets/search
   - High P95 latency (892ms) - consider optimization
   - Database operations dominate request time - optimize queries or add caching
   - Consider implementing pagination for large result sets

📊 POST:/api/v1/tickets
   - Large response payloads - consider pagination or compression
   - External API calls are slow - consider caching or async processing

✅ Overall System Health: GOOD
   - Error rate: 0.8% (threshold: 5%)
   - Average latency: 142ms (threshold: 500ms)
   - Throughput: 324 req/s

# 6. Security Analysis

echo "========================"
echo "Analyzing routes for security issues..."
echo ""
cat << 'EOF'
🔒 Security Analysis Report
==========================

Critical Issues (0):
✅ No critical security issues found

High Priority (2):
⚠️  /api/v1/auth/password/reset - Sensitive data in URL path
   Recommendation: Use POST body for sensitive data
⚠️  /admin/* routes missing rate limiting
   Recommendation: Add rate limiting middleware

Medium Priority (3):
ℹ️  12 admin routes without explicit auth requirements
   Recommendation: Ensure auth middleware is applied at prefix level
ℹ️  CORS headers not configured for API routes
   Recommendation: Configure appropriate CORS policies
ℹ️  No CSRF protection detected
   Recommendation: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

Low Priority (5):
📝 Missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
📝 No request size limits configured
📝 Debug endpoints exposed in production
📝 Verbose error messages may leak information
📝 Consider implementing API versioning strategy

Security Score: B+ (Good)
Next Steps: Address high priority issues first

📊 Route Dependency Analysis
===========================

Route Groups and Dependencies:
------------------------------
├── authentication (core)
│   └── Required by: ALL protected routes
├── health-checks (core)
│   └── No dependencies
├── agent-dashboard (agent)
│   ├── Depends on: authentication, permissions
│   └── Calls: ticket-api, customer-api, queue-api
├── customer-portal (customer)
│   ├── Depends on: authentication
│   └── Calls: ticket-api, kb-api
└── admin-customer-companies (admin)
    ├── Depends on: authentication, admin-permissions
    └── Calls: customer-api, company-api

Circular Dependencies: ✅ None detected

Unused Routes: 
- GET:/api/v1/legacy/tickets (marked for deprecation)
- POST:/api/v1/test/webhook (test endpoint)

High Coupling Routes (consider refactoring):
- GET:/api/v1/reports/dashboard (calls 12 other endpoints)
- POST:/api/v1/tickets/bulk (complex dependencies)

Middleware Chain Analysis:
- Average middleware depth: 3.2
- Maximum middleware depth: 7 (admin routes)
- Most used middleware: auth (87%), logging (100%), cors (62%)
