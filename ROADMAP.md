# GOTRS Development

## Recent Achievements (December 2025)
- Inbound email pipeline (POP3 connector factory, postmaster processor, external ticket rules example, mail account metadata/tests).
- Scheduler jobs CLI and metrics publishing.
- Admin customer company create POST route restored; YAML manifests regenerated (including admin dynamic aliases).
- Ticket creation validation tightened; queue meta partial added; dynamic module handler wiring fixed.
- E2E/Playwright and schema discovery suites refreshed.

## Test Stabilization Progress (Internal/API)
- ✅ Queue API/HTMX suites pass - 🟢 Queues - UI exists, queue detail functionality working (statistics + recent tickets + filtered ticket list)DB-less fallbacks for CI without DB)
- ✅ Priority API suites pass
- ✅ User API suites pass (list/get/create/update/delete, groups)
- ✅ Ticket search UI/API pass (q/search, pagination, "No results")
- ✅ Queue detail JSON/HTML and pagination helpers aligned with tests
- ✅ Type CRUD handlers aligned with sqlmock expectations (DB-backed and fallback)
- ✅ Agent Ticket Zoom handlers gain deterministic test-mode fallbacks
- ✅ Admin middleware bypassed in test env to avoid 403 HTML noise
- ✅ Auth bypass flag enforced: setting `GOTRS_DISABLE_TEST_AUTH_BYPASS=1` now forces admin surfaces to fail closed during regression runs
- ✅ **TEMPLATE VALIDATION** - Critical templates validated at startup
- ✅ **HTML FALLBACK CLEANUP** - Replaced embedded HTML with JSON responses
- ✅ **CODE CLEANUP** - Removed duplicate commented code blocks
- ✅ Core toolbox-test now green (cmd/goats, internal/api, generated)
- ✅ Reminder notification feed + snooze action wired end-to-end (`/api/notifications/pending` + `/api/tickets/:id/status` alias)
- ⚠️ Some DB-heavy integration tests still skipped when DB/templates unavailable

### Code Quality Improvements (September 23, 2025)
- ✅ **Template System Robustness**: Enhanced validation validates 5 critical templates at startup
- ✅ **HTML Fallback Cleanup**: Replaced complex embedded HTML with clean JSON error responses
- ✅ **Code Deduplication**: Removed 200+ lines of duplicate commented code from htmx_routes.go
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Consistent JSON error responses across HTMX endpoints
- ✅ **Architecture**: Better separation between template rendering and error handling 🚀 Current Status (September 23, 2025)

**Major Milestone: Code Quality & Queue Enhancement Complete**
- ✅ Database schema exists (OTRS-compatible)
- ✅ Admin UI modules display (functionality varies)
- ✅ Authentication works (root@localhost after running `make synthesize`)
- ✅ **FULL MYSQL COMPATIBILITY** - Fixed all placeholder conversion issues
- ✅ **TEMPLATE SYSTEM ROBUSTNESS** - Enhanced validation and error handling
- ✅ **HTML FALLBACK CLEANUP** - Replaced embedded HTML with JSON error responses
- ✅ **CODE CLEANUP** - Removed 200+ lines of duplicate commented code
- ✅ **QUEUE DETAIL FUNCTIONALITY** - Real-time statistics and enhanced ticket display with filtered list view
- ✅ Agent/tickets endpoint working without database errors
- ✅ Agent ticket functionality, creation UI, viewing and ticket management UIs
- ✅ **Basic Email Threading** - RFC-compliant Message-ID, In-Reply-To, and References headers implemented
- ❌ No customer portal

**Recent Success**: Completed comprehensive code quality improvements including template system robustness, HTML fallback cleanup, and code deduplication. System now has proper error handling and cleaner architecture. **Latest Achievement**: Queue detail pages now display real-time statistics and enhanced ticket listings with navigation.

**New Achievement (October 19, 2025)**: Reminder toasts are actionable end-to-end. The legacy `/api/notifications/pending` endpoint now resolves to the HTMX handler, and a matching `/api/tickets/:id/status` alias keeps snooze posts working without the `/agent` prefix. Routes manifest and regression tests cover the flow.

**New Achievement (October 22, 2025)**: Ticket Zoom history and links fragments render consistently across PostgreSQL and MariaDB. History pulls article subjects from `article_data_mime`, and the links repository now duplicates placeholder parameters when `database.ConvertQuery` expands `$1` to multiple `?` tokens, preventing MariaDB-specific 500s. Ticket history parity achieved across agent/admin flows. The shared recorder now maps OTRS/Znuny history types, persists `ticket_history` entries for each action, and the History tab renders real timelines with repository and service test coverage.

**New Achievement (November 1, 2025)**: Email threading support implemented with RFC-compliant Message-ID, In-Reply-To, and References headers for conversation tracking in customer notifications. Database schema updated to store threading metadata, and agent routes now include threading headers when sending customer emails.

- 🟡 Users Management - UI exists, functionality unknown
- 🟡 Groups Management - UI exists, functionality unknown
- ❌ Customer Users - 404 error
- 🟡 Customer Companies - UI exists, functionality unknown
- � Queues - UI exists, queue detail functionality working (statistics + recent tickets)
- 🟡 Priorities - UI exists, functionality unknown
- 🟡 States - UI exists, functionality unknown
- 🟡 Types - UI exists, core list/create/update/delete wired; test-mode fallbacks added
- 🟡 SLA Management - UI exists, functionality unknown
- ❌ Services - 404 error
- 🟡 Lookups - UI exists, functionality unknown
- ❌ Roles/Permissions matrix - Not implemented
- ❌ Dynamic Fields - Not implemented
- ❌ Templates - Not implemented
- ❌ Signatures/Salutations - Not implemented

**Note**: "UI exists" means the page loads with authentication, actual CRUD functionality not verified

### 🔧 Phase 4: Database Compatibility Enhancements - IN PROGRESS (December 2025)

**Critical for True OTRS Compatibility**

**Why This Matters**:
- Current import only handles 11 of 116 OTRS tables
- Cannot truly claim "100% OTRS compatible" without full schema support
- OTRS uses XML schema definitions with database-specific drivers
- We need similar abstraction but with modern YAML approach

**Architecture Decisions** (December 29, 2025):
1. **YAML over XML**: 50% less verbose, easier to maintain
2. **Pure Driver Pattern**: No hybrid model, clean separation
3. **Universal Migration**: Support any source to any target
4. **SQL Dump Support**: Import from files, not just live databases

**Implementation Components**:

#### Database Driver Interface
```go
type DatabaseDriver interface {
    CreateTable(schema TableSchema) string
    Insert(table string, data map[string]interface{}) (Query, error)
    Update(table string, data map[string]interface{}, where string) (Query, error)
    Delete(table string, where string) (Query, error)
    MapType(schemaType string) string
    SupportsReturning() bool
    BeginTx() (Transaction, error)
}
```

#### YAML Schema Format
```yaml
# schemas/customer_company.yaml
customer_company:
  pk: customer_id  # Non-standard primary key
  columns:
    customer_id: varchar(150)!  # ! = required
    name: varchar(200)! unique
    street: varchar(200)?  # ? = nullable
    valid_id: smallint! default(1)
  indexes:
    - name
  timestamps: true  # Adds create_time, change_time
```

#### Supported Drivers
1. **PostgreSQL**: Full feature support, RETURNING clauses
2. **MySQL**: Compatibility mode, AUTO_INCREMENT mapping
3. **SQLite**: Testing only, in-memory support
4. **MySQL Dump**: Parse and import .sql files
5. **PostgreSQL Dump**: Parse and import .sql files

#### Universal Migration Tool
```bash
# Live database to database
gotrs-migrate --source mysql://user:pass@host/db \
              --target postgres://user:pass@host/db

# SQL dump to database  
gotrs-migrate --source mysql-dump://dump.sql \
              --target postgres://user:pass@host/db

# Database to SQL dump
gotrs-migrate --source postgres://user:pass@host/db \
              --target mysql-dump://export.sql
```

**Benefits**:
- **100% OTRS Import**: All 116 tables, not just 11
- **Database Independence**: Switch between MySQL/PostgreSQL freely
- **Better Testing**: Use SQLite for fast unit tests
- **Clean Architecture**: No SQL in business logic
- **Migration Flexibility**: Import from dumps or live databases

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Import all 116 OTRS tables successfully
- [ ] Export to MySQL format readable by OTRS
- [ ] Same test suite passes on PostgreSQL and MySQL
- [ ] 1GB dump migrates in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Zero hardcoded SQL in repositories

**Timeline**: December 29, 2025 - January 5, 2026

## 🎯 Realistic MVP Timeline (Starting Now)

### Week 1: Core Ticket System (Aug 29 - Sep 4, 2025)
**Must Have - Without this, nothing else matters:**
- [x] Implement ticket creation API (remove TODO stubs)
- [x] Create ticket submission form UI
- [x] Display ticket list (agent view) — minimal fallback for tests
- [x] Full ticket detail view (ticket zoom now renders live data)
- [x] Generate proper ticket numbers

### Week 2: Ticket Management (Sep 5-11, 2025)
- [x] Article/comment system (add replies to tickets)
- [x] Ticket status updates
- [x] Agent assignment functionality
- [x] Queue transfer capability
- [x] Basic search functionality — UI/API search with pagination (tests passing)

### Week 3: Customer Features (Sep 12-18, 2025)
- [ ] Customer portal login
- [ ] Customer ticket submission form
- [ ] View own tickets
- [ ] Add replies to own tickets
- [ ] Email notifications (basic)

### Week 4: Testing & Stabilization (Sep 19-25, 2025)
- [ ] Fix critical bugs discovered in weeks 1-3
- [ ] Basic integration tests
- [ ] Performance verification
- [ ] Documentation of working features
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment

**🚀 MVP Target: September 30, 2025**
- Agents can manage tickets
- Customers can submit and track tickets
- Basic email notifications work
- System is stable enough for pilot users

## ❌ Critical Missing Features for ANY Ticketing System

**Without these, GOTRS is not a ticketing system:**
1. **Ticket Creation** - Can't create tickets via UI or API
2. **Ticket Viewing** - Can't see ticket details
3. **Ticket Updates** - Can't change status, assign, or modify tickets
4. **Comments/Articles** - Can't add replies or internal notes
5. **Customer Access** - No way for customers to submit tickets
6. **Email Integration** - Basic email threading implemented, full email-to-ticket and notifications pending
7. **Search** - Can't find tickets
8. **Reports** - No metrics or statistics

**Current Reality**: Agent/API ticket creation, attachments, real ticket zoom, and status/assignment workflows are live; customer access and outbound email remain open.

## 📊 Honest Current Metrics (September 3, 2025)

| Metric | Reality | MVP Target |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Core Ticket Functionality | **20%** | 100% |
| Admin Modules Working | Unknown | 80% |
| Tickets in Database | **0** | 100+ |
| API Endpoints Complete | ~35% | 80% |
| Customer Portal | **0%** | Basic |
| Email Integration | **25%** | Basic |
| Production Readiness | **0%** | 70% |
| Test Coverage | Improving (core suites green) | 50% |
| Days Until MVP Target | **28 days** | - |

## 🚦 Major Risks to MVP

1. **No Ticket System**: The core functionality doesn't exist
   - Mitigation: Drop everything else, focus ONLY on tickets for Week 1

2. **Unknown Admin Module Status**: UI exists but functionality untested
   - Mitigation: Test and fix only what's needed for tickets, ignore the rest

3. **Tight Timeline**: Only 33 days to September 30 MVP target
   - Mitigation: Drastically reduced scope, only bare minimum for MVP

4. **No Testing**: Can't verify what actually works
   - Mitigation: Manual testing only for MVP, automation later

## 🎖️ Version History

| Version | Date | Status | Reality Check |
|---------|------|--------|---------------|
| 0.1.0 | Aug 17, 2025 | Claimed | Database schema exists |
| 0.2.0 | Aug 24, 2025 | Claimed | Some admin UIs load |
| 0.3.0 | Aug 27, 2025 | Claimed | Schema migrations work |
| - | Aug 28, 2025 | Historical | Early stabilization tracking |
| 0.4.0 | Oct 20, 2025 | Released | Preferred queue automation, coverage harness |

## 🔮 Post-MVP Roadmap (Aspirational)

### Epic: Secrets & Configuration Hardening
- **Current posture (all editions)**: keep runtime secrets in `.env` files or orchestrator-provided environment variables. This matches our Docker/Podman Compose workflow and keeps developer onboarding frictionless. `.env.example` already warns operators to rotate every value before production and to store the file outside version control.
- **Kubernetes fit (community)**: the same contract maps cleanly onto `Secret` manifests. Operators can mount an env file via projected secrets or rely on `envFrom`, so we can document “copy `.env` contents into a Kubernetes Secret” without touching code. This becomes part of the Phase 2 deployment docs.
- **Future enhancements (enterprise)**: optional vault-backed secret adapters (HashiCorp Vault Agent, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) delivered as enterprise add-ons. These would refresh credentials automatically, publish audit events, and remove `.env` handling entirely for regulated tenants. We explicitly defer implementation until after inbound email/connectors stabilize.
- **Guardrails**: keep `.env` ignored in git (already true), document file-permission expectations, and add CI lint to flag obvious demo secrets in committed YAML. No schema or runtime changes are required for this epic’s initial community scope.

**Phase 1: Stabilization (Q4 2025)**
- Complete all admin modules to production quality
- Comprehensive test coverage (80%+)
- Performance optimization for 1000+ concurrent users
- Full email integration (inbound and outbound)
- Complete API documentation
- OTRS migration tools tested with real data

**Phase 2: Enhancement (Q1-Q2 2026)**
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Workflow automation engine
- Knowledge base integration
- Multi-language support (i18n)
- REST API v2 with GraphQL
- Kubernetes deployment manifests

**Phase 3: Innovation (2026+)**
- Mobile applications (iOS/Android)
- AI-powered ticket classification and routing
- Predictive analytics for SLA management
- Plugin marketplace for extensions
- Enterprise integrations (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack)
- Cloud/SaaS offering

*Note: These are aspirational goals contingent on achieving a stable MVP first*

*Last updated: November 13, 2025 - Ticket history parity recorded; History tab now reflects persisted actions across agent and admin flows.*

---

## 🔄 Update: October 2, 2025 – MVP Focus & Anti-Regression Plan

No additional core ticketing capabilities have been implemented since the September 23 update. All previously marked ✅ items remain valid. Work now shifts from infrastructural cleanup to delivering the first true ticket vertical slice while aggressively preventing further regressions.

### 🎯 Immediate MVP Focus (Strict Priority Order)
1. ✅ Ticket creation vertical slice (API handler, HTMX form, persistence, history, attachments) – landed October 28, 2025.  
   - Agent and API paths now share validation, repository-backed TNs, article bootstrap, and history recording.  
   - HTMX responses redirect to the canonical `/tickets/<id>` view and surface attachment results.
2. ✅ Deterministic ticket number generator – in production since October 4, 2025 with property/race coverage.
3. ✅ Real ticket zoom (Pongo2) replaces the test-mode fallback with live articles, time entries, and customer context.
4. ✅ Articles/comments system – public and internal replies wired through REST + HTMX fragments with visibility handling.
5. ✅ Status transitions & assignment workflow (new → open → closed, agent & queue transfer endpoints) – delivered October 28, 2025.
6. ✅ **Email Threading Support** - RFC-compliant Message-ID, In-Reply-To, and References headers implemented for conversation tracking – delivered November 1, 2025.
7. Minimal customer portal (login, submit ticket, view/respond to own tickets).
8. Outbound email notification (one-way) via pluggable SMTP adapter + mail-sink container (fire on create + public reply) – **next active item**.
8. Hardening / regression pass (stabilization freeze) before tagging 0.4.0.

### ✅ Already Done / Do NOT Rework Now
- Ticket creation vertical slice (API handler, HTMX form, attachments, history)
- Real ticket zoom rendering with live articles & time accounting
- Status transitions & assignment workflow (state changes, agent + queue transfer)
- Queue detail statistics + ticket list
- Search API/UI basic pagination
- Type CRUD & fallback test harness
- Template validation for critical set (extend later, not now)

### 🧪 Anti-Regression Strategy (Actionable)
| Layer | Action | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Unit (domain) | Ticket number generator property & race tests | Prevent duplicate / out-of-order numbers |
| Repo Contract | Interface-level tests run against Postgres & MySQL containers | Ensures placeholder conversion stability |
| API Contract | JSON golden files for create/view/update ticket endpoints | Detect schema drift |
| HTML Snapshot | Deterministic template render (strip dynamic timestamps) | Catch accidental markup changes |
| Template Validation | Expand from 5 to +ticket_create + ticket_zoom after they land | Fast fail on missing templates |
| DB-Less Mode | Maintain lightweight in-memory ticket repo for CI quick path | Keep feedback loop fast |
| CI Gates | Require green: unit, repo contract (2 DBs), API goldens, template validation | Block regressions early |
| Merge Discipline | <300 LOC functional changes per PR, vertical slice increments | Reduce blast radius |

### 🔐 Risk Mitigations
- Placeholder Conversion Regressions → Keep ConvertPlaceholders unit + integration tests per new query
- Template Drift → Snapshot tests + startup validation expansion
- Concurrency Issues (ticket create) → Sequence backed + race test
- Silent HTML Errors → Force JSON + HTML dual asserts in tests for new handlers

### 📌 Success Definition for This Slice
- Create → redirect to real zoom (not fallback)
- Ticket number visible & stable across refreshes
- Add at least one public and one internal article
- Change status & assign agent without error
- Customer can create & view only their tickets
- Notification event logged (even if email sink is noop in dev)

### 🗂 Work Packaging (Suggested PR Sequence)
1. Data Model Additions: ticket number sequence + article table (if not present)
2. Ticket Create API + repository methods + tests (unit + contract)
3. HTMX Create Form + template + HTML snapshot test
4. Real Ticket Zoom (read path) + JSON/HTML tests
5. Ticket Number Generator hardening (property + race tests)
6. Articles add/list + differentiation (public/internal)
7. Status & assignment endpoints + minimal UI controls
8. Customer portal minimal (auth reuse + list/create/view)
9. Notification interface + outbound stub implementation
10. Stabilization: expand template validation + goldens + docs

### 🧱 Deferred (Post-MVP Explicitly)
- Inbound email processing
- Advanced search facets / reporting
- SLA engine
- Dynamic fields system
- Full admin module audit

### 📉 Scope Guardrails
- No workflow engine now (only 3 status states)
- No bulk actions
- No rich text (plain text articles)
- No attachment handling yet

### 🔍 Metrics to Track During Implementation
- Time from commit to green CI (<5 min target with DB-less fast path)
- Test count & duration per layer (watch for >20% jump per PR)
- Ticket creation p95 in local container (<150ms target)

### 🕓 Target Calendar Adjustment
Given slippage past original Sept 30 MVP, set a realistic 0.4.0 target: **October 31, 2025** with weekly stabilization checkpoints (no new scope last 5 days of month).

### 📘 Documentation To Update Incrementally
- ROADMAP (this file)
- API reference: ticket create / view / update endpoints
- Template validation list
- Testing README: how to run contract + snapshot suites

*Last updated: October 2, 2025 – Added MVP focus sequence and anti-regression strategy. No new core ticket features since prior update; execution pivots to ticket vertical slice.*

---

### ✅ Update: October 4, 2025 – Ticket Number Generator Live
Successfully created first real ticket via new generator path (example ID: `20251004094740`).
- Roadmap item "Generate proper ticket numbers" marked complete.
- Legacy `generateTicketNumber()` fully removed; repository/service use injected `ticketnumber.Generator`.
- Next focus: real ticket creation handler + zoom view (replace test-mode fallback) and article system.

No further action needed on numbering unless hot reload requirement emerges.

---

### ✅ Update: October 5, 2025 – Admin Dashboard Dedup & Queue Overview Stats

Status since Oct 4:
- Refactored admin dashboard to reuse exported handler (removed duplicated inline implementation) – stabilizes navigation context injection (commit: `1f41701`).
- Ensured persistent visibility of Admin & Dev tabs across admin routes (nav condition relaxation).
- Agent Queues overview page upgraded with per-queue state counts (new/open/pending/closed/total) + search filter (commit: `ba20161`).
- Dark mode contrast & UI polish adjustments applied to totals column.
- No additional ticket vertical slice capabilities landed yet (creation, articles, status changes still pending).

Next Immediate Focus (unchanged priority): Ticket Creation Vertical Slice
1. Implement ticket creation API handler (persist ticket + initial article, redirect to real zoom).
2. HTMX create form (agent) with validation (queue, title, priority).
3. Real ticket zoom (replace fallback) rendering ticket + (empty) articles list.
4. Begin article (public/internal) add path.

Risk Watch:
- Scope creep into articles before create path is stable – enforce sequence above.
- Template drift – add new templates to startup validation once create + zoom land.

No roadmap timeline adjustments required; proceeding with vertical slice execution next.

---

### ✅ Update: October 12, 2025 – OTRS FS Compatibility, Compose Wiring, Docs

Delivered items:
- [x] Adopted OTRS/Znuny filesystem layout for attachments across runtime
- [x] docker-compose unified: STORAGE_PATH env + volume mapping kept in sync
- [x] Documentation: added compose examples for mounting existing OTRS var/article (read-only and read-write), with SELinux notes

Impact:
- Smooth runtime compatibility with existing OTRS/Znuny attachment stores (read and write in-place)
- Clear migration path for filesystem-based installs
- No changes to MVP ticket vertical slice status; remaining work continues per Immediate MVP Focus

---

### ✅ Update: October 19, 2025 – Reminder Toast Snooze Flow

- Routed `/api/notifications/pending` through the exported reminder handler so toast polling works without 404s
- Added POST `/api/tickets/:id/status` alias in YAML to mirror legacy API expectations for snooze actions
- Updated handler registry (`HandleUpdateTicketStatus`) and regenerated `runtime/routes-manifest.json`
- Extended `internal/api` tests to cover the status update handler wiring
- Restarted containers via `make restart` to verify the end-to-end reminder snooze flow in production-like settings

### ✅ Update: October 20, 2025 – Not Closed Filter & i18n Alignment

- `/tickets` and `/agent/tickets` now default to the `not_closed` status, exposing it explicitly in each filter dropdown
- Repository list queries honor `ExcludeClosedStates`, joining `ticket_state_type` to avoid over-fetching closed tickets
- `tickets.not_closed` translation delivered for EN/DE/ES/AR/TLH so the new option localizes correctly
- Cleaned temporary debug logging from the agent ticket list handler to keep production logs focused on actionable errors

### ✅ Update: October 28, 2025 – Ticket Creation Vertical Slice Complete

- `/api/tickets` now runs through the repository-backed service: queue/state validation, generator-issued ticket numbers, initial article bootstrap, and history recording.
- Agent HTMX ticket creation persists attachments, optional time accounting, and issues `HX-Redirect` to the canonical ticket zoom.
- Ticket zoom (`pages/ticket_detail.pongo2`) renders newly created tickets with live articles, history feed, time accounting, and customer context.
- Status transitions, agent assignment, and queue transfer endpoints are wired into both HTMX flows and JSON APIs with matching history entries.
- API + HTMX suites updated with Postgres defaults and history assertions; `make test` stays green inside toolbox runtimes.
- **Next focus**: status & assignment transitions, then SMTP mailer integration backed by a mail-sink container for local acceptance tests.

## 🧩 Planned: Ticket Number Generator Integration & Config Wiring (October 2025)

This section captures the precise, minimal, non-duplicative plan to wire the existing unified YAML configuration platform to the already implemented ticket number generators in `internal/ticketnumber/` without recreating solved components.

### Current State (Baseline)
* Generators implemented & tested: AutoIncrement (Increment), Date, DateChecksum, Random.
* Counter abstraction (`DBStore`) present; concurrency tests green.
* Unified YAML platform (versioning, lint, schema, hot reload) fully operational (`internal/yamlmgmt`).
* `ConfigAdapter` can import legacy `config/Config.yaml` and expose settings (slice-based `settings` list).
* Schema defines settings `SystemID` and `Ticket::NumberGenerator` but runtime server code does not consume them.
* Ticket creation path still uses legacy daily counting logic (not generator interface).

### Goals
1. Resolve generator name from config (`Ticket::NumberGenerator`) at startup.
2. Obtain `SystemID` from config (int → string) and feed to generator config.
3. Inject a `ticketnumber.Generator` into ticket creation workflow (repository/service) instead of legacy function.
4. Provide safe fallback & logging on invalid configuration.
5. Enable (optional) hot reload of generator if config changes, without destabilizing in-flight operations.
6. Add targeted integration tests (config → generator → produced number shape) without duplicating existing unit tests.

### Non-Goals (Avoid Rework)
* Do NOT re-implement YAML parsing / version management / lint / schema.
* Do NOT convert `settings` slice to a map prematurely (optimize later if needed).
* Do NOT build a second configuration loader.
* Do NOT change generator algorithms (already parity tested).
* Do NOT expand schema yet (reuse existing names exactly: `Increment`, `Date`, `DateChecksum`, `Random`).

### Implementation Steps (Minimal Surface)
1. Bootstrap at server startup:
   * Instantiate `yamlmgmt.VersionManager` pointing to config dir (if not already).
   * If no current `system-config`, call `ConfigAdapter.ImportConfigYAML("./config/Config.yaml")` (idempotent guard).
2. Create lightweight runtime accessor (optional helper) or reuse `ConfigAdapter` directly for `GetConfigValue`.
3. Add `internal/ticketnumber/registry.go`:
   * `func Resolve(name string, sysID string, store CounterStore, clk Clock) (Generator, error)`.
   * Internal map: `Increment -> AutoIncrement`, `Date -> Date`, `DateChecksum -> DateChecksum`, `Random -> Random`.
   * Case-sensitive match (exact per schema); return error if unknown.
4. Retrieve values:
   * `sysIDVal, _ := adapter.GetConfigValue("SystemID")` (int or string) → normalize to string.
   * `genNameVal, _ := adapter.GetConfigValue("Ticket::NumberGenerator")` → string.
5. Instantiate `DBStore` with `SystemID` once (share among generators requiring counters).
6. Resolve generator; on error log warning & fallback (policy below).
7. Refactor ticket creation path:
   * Inject `Generator` into repository/service struct (constructor parameter).
   * Replace legacy `generateTicketNumber()` with `g.Generate(ctx)`. (DONE – legacy function removed from repository & service)
8. (Deferred Optional) Register hot reload handler for `KindConfig`:
   * On changed settings: if either `SystemID` or `Ticket::NumberGenerator` changed, rebuild generator under mutex swap.
9. Add integration tests:
   * Table: generator name → regex pattern assert (e.g., DateChecksum: `^\d{8}\d{2}\d{5}\d$`).
   * Invalid name scenario: set to `Bogus` → expect fallback + logged warning.
10. Documentation updates:
   * Add brief “Ticket Number Generator Selection” subsection referencing config keys (in this ROADMAP + maybe a dedicated doc later).

### Fallback & Error Policy
* Unknown `Ticket::NumberGenerator` → log warning once at startup; fallback order: prefer `DateChecksum` (checksum safety) then `Date` if that somehow fails.
* Missing `SystemID` → default to `10` (current examples) with warning.
* Hot reload invalid change: keep existing generator; emit warning event.

### Hot Reload Strategy (Initial)
* Phase 1: No live swap (static at startup) – simplest path to delivery.
* Phase 2 (optional): Add handler; atomic pointer swap of `Generator`; maintain metrics (reload count, last change time).
* Guard: if generator type switches between counter-based and random, reuse existing `DBStore`; safe as interface doesn’t retain state besides config.

### Testing Strategy
* Reuse existing unit/concurrency tests (no duplication).
* New integration test harness builds minimal in-memory config version via `VersionManager` (no filesystem dependency if feasible) OR uses temp dir inside `tmp/` (ignored by git) consistent with project rules.
* Patterns asserted, not concrete numbers (avoid flakiness for date/time).
* Log capture for invalid name fallback test.

### Risk & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Config adapter returns unexpected type (int vs float64 from YAML decode) | Normalize via type switch utility |
| Concurrent ticket creation during generator swap (future hot reload) | Atomic pointer + RW mutex; not needed Phase 1 |
| Legacy code paths still call old function | Grep & remove/redirect `generateTicketNumber` usages | DONE |
| Performance regression on each number generation (re-reading config) | Resolve once; generator holds config values |
| Fallback masking real config errors | Emit structured warning (once) + metric counter |

### Minimal PR Sequencing
1. Registry + startup wiring (static resolution) + repository injection (no hot reload).
2. Replace all legacy calls & remove dead code; add integration tests.
3. Optional: hot reload handler + swap logic.
4. Docs + metrics (if desired) – small follow-up.

### Done Criteria
* Startup logs chosen generator and SystemID.
* Ticket creation path exclusively uses `ticketnumber.Generator`.
* Changing config (manual edit + re-import) and restarting picks new format.
* All existing tests still green; new integration tests pass.
* No duplicated config parsing logic introduced.
* ROADMAP & (optional) docs mention configuration keys clearly.

### Deferred (Explicitly)
* Runtime hot reload of generator (Phase 2).
* Exposure of generator choice in an admin UI.
* Metrics (counter collisions, generation latency).
* Alternative legacy daily counter compatibility layer (only if required later).

## 🐐 Platform vs Product Executables (GoatKit vs GoTRS) – Draft Plan (Captured Oct 4, 2025)

Purpose: Preserve intent to evolve a reusable platform (GoatKit) while continuing product (GoTRS) feature delivery without losing focus on current A-path work (ticket number integration & ticket vertical slice).

### Current Executable Inventory (cmd/)
Platform‑leaning tools (can be generalized):
- route-docs, route-lint, route-version, routes-diff, routes-manifest
- gotrs-config, gk (config manager / alias)
- schema-discovery
- contract-runner
- generator (code/resource generation)
- xlat-extract, test_xlat, test_i18n, add-translations (i18n tooling)

Product / domain-specific (GoTRS / OTRS compatibility):
- gotrs (CLI with synthesize/reset-user)
- goats (likely current server runtime – confirm before refactor)
- gotrs-db, gotrs-migrate, gotrs-babelfish, import-otrs
- gotrs-storage
- add-ticket-translations (ticket-domain i18n)

Ambiguous / needs review:
- services/ (entrypoints pending inspection)
- generator (scope clarity required)

### Gap Summary
- No namespace separation (all under gotrs-ce).
- Platform identity “GoatKit” not yet codified (no `kit-` binaries).
- Platform code lives in product-centric package paths; prevents external adopters.

### Incremental Extraction Strategy
Phase 1 (Documentation Only – low risk):
1. Classify executables (DONE here – persist in repo).
2. Add Makefile groups: PLATFORM_BINARIES / PRODUCT_BINARIES (future task).

Phase 2 (Aliases & Identity):
1. Introduce alias wrappers: `kit-config` (calls gotrs-config), `kit-routes` (multiplexer for route-* tools), `kit-i18n`.
2. Help text prints deprecation notice for old names once aliases stable.

Phase 3 (Package Boundary):
1. Create `pkg/kit/...` (public) or `internal/kit/...` (staging) for: config versioning facade, route versioning, i18n extract, ticket number generator interface.
2. Move thin adapters in product layer referencing reused core.

Phase 4 (Module Split – optional later):
1. New module `github.com/gotrs-io/goatkit`.
2. Migrate packages; keep replace directive locally during transition.

### Non-Goals Now
- No immediate renaming of existing binaries; avoid churn while ticket vertical slice incomplete.
- No premature module split before core ticket creation + generator wiring are stable.

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Distraction from MVP | Timebox platform work after ticket slice milestones |
| User scripts break with new names | Provide aliases + deprecation period |
| Over-extraction before API stabilizes | Defer module split; start with doc + alias |

### Action Backlog (To Revisit Post Ticket Slice)
1. Add Makefile groups & echo in help target.
2. Introduce alias binaries (tiny main wrappers).
3. Draft `pkg/kit` README (scope + stability promises).
4. Identify minimal stable interfaces (ConfigVersioning, RouteVersioning, IdentifierGenerator, I18NExtractor).
5. Prepare migration guide for adopting GoatKit separately.

## 🧩 Service Registry Evolution (Aspirational) – Added Oct 5, 2025

File: `config/services.yaml.disabled`

Status: Prototype / not loaded. Represents a future declarative multi‑service registry (DB primary/replica, cache, search, queue, storage) with bindings and migration strategies.

Current Reality:
- Runtime today only auto‑configures a single database (`primary-db`) from environment variables via `internal/services/adapter/database_adapter.go`.
- No YAML ingestion path; the disabled file is inert.
- Other declared services (cache, search, queue, storage) are not provisioned through a unified loader.

Why It Matters (Future Value):
- Centralize connection definitions (credentials via env interpolation) for portability.
- Enable blue/green + canary migration orchestration (already sketched in file under `migrations:`).
- Provide consistent binding model across apps (`gotrs`, future analytics workers) instead of ad‑hoc env wiring.

Phase Placement:
- Target implementation window: **Phase 2: Enhancement (Q1–Q2 2026)**, after core ticket vertical slice and stabilization are complete.

Planned Minimal Increment (Phase 2 Early):
1. Define loader: parse `config/services.yaml` (if present) → validate schema → register services & bindings.
2. Environment interpolation `${VAR}` with required/optional semantics and startup validation.
3. Fallback: if file absent, retain current env auto-config path.
4. Expose `/admin/debug/services` endpoint enumerating registered services & health.

Deferred (Later in Phase 2 or Phase 3):
- Live migration orchestrator (blue‑green/canary execution engine) with progress events.
- Health monitoring + automatic failover for replica → primary promotion.
- Secret resolution via external vault provider abstraction.

Risks & Mitigations:
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Overcomplicates early MVP | Keep loader optional; ignore if file missing |
| Stale credentials cached | Short TTL or on-demand refresh for credentialed services |
| Divergent config sources | Single authoritative registry when file present; disable env auto-config except overrides |

Exit Criteria (Phase 2 milestone):
- Loader activated when `config/services.yaml` exists (renamed from `.disabled`).
- All currently hard-coded DB init paths refactored to registry consumption.
- Admin debug endpoint lists at least primary-db + replica-db with health state.
- Documentation section added describing format & precedence.

Action (Before Phase 2 Starts):
- Keep the file disabled to avoid confusion; no partial loader implementation.
- Revisit once ticket system + core admin modules are stable and Viper integration settled.
