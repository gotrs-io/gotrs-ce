# Legal Notice and Compatibility Statement

## Project Independence

GOTRS-CE (Go Ticket Request System - Community Edition) is an **independent, original implementation** of a ticket management system. This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or derived from OTRS AG or the OTRS software.

## Our Approach to Compatibility

### What We Do:
- **Independent Implementation**: All code in GOTRS-CE is originally written and not copied from any other project
- **Interface Compatibility**: We maintain database schema compatibility for interoperability purposes only
- **Clean Room Development**: Our implementation is based on publicly available specifications and standards
- **Open Standards**: We follow industry-standard practices for ticket management systems

### What We DON'T Do:
- We do NOT copy source code from OTRS or any other ticketing system
- We do NOT use proprietary algorithms or business logic from other systems
- We do NOT claim affiliation with or endorsement from OTRS AG
- We do NOT use trademarked names except for compatibility descriptions

## Compatibility Rationale

Database schema compatibility is maintained solely for the purpose of:
1. Enabling data migration for users transitioning between systems
2. Allowing third-party tools to work with multiple ticketing systems
3. Following established industry patterns for ticket management

This is similar to how:
- LibreOffice maintains file format compatibility with Microsoft Office
- Wine implements Windows APIs for Linux
- MariaDB maintains compatibility with MySQL

## Intellectual Property

- All code in GOTRS-CE is original work by its contributors
- Database table and column names match industry standards for interoperability
- No creative expressions, comments, or documentation are copied from other projects
- Business logic and algorithms are independently developed

## Trademarks

- OTRS® is a registered trademark of OTRS AG
- We use this trademark only for factual compatibility descriptions
- GOTRS-CE is not affiliated with OTRS AG

## License

GOTRS-CE is licensed under [LICENSE TYPE - TO BE DETERMINED], which allows for commercial and non-commercial use while ensuring the project remains open source.

## Contributing

Contributors must:
1. Only submit original work
2. Not copy code from other projects
3. Follow clean-room implementation practices
4. Respect intellectual property rights
