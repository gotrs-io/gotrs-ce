## Temporary Critical Standards

- Database access: use `database.ConvertPlaceholders` for every SQL string (no exceptions).
- **Dynamic SQL**: use `database.QueryBuilder` for any dynamic WHERE/column construction (mandatory for gosec compliance).
- No ORM: use `database/sql` with small repositories.
- Keep SQL in repositories, not handlers.
- Templating: Pongo2 only. Do not use Go's `html/template`. Render user-facing views via Pongo2 with `layouts/base.pongo2` and proper context (`User`, `ActivePage`).
- Routing: All routes defined in YAML under `routes/*.yaml` using the YAML router. Do not register routes directly in Go code.
- Tests: add/update tests for any DB-affecting change; run `make test`.

## Go Performance Standards

### Preallocate Slices (Required)
When building a slice in a loop where the size is known:

```go
// ❌ Wrong - causes multiple reallocations
var results []Item
for _, src := range items {
    results = append(results, transform(src))
}

// ✅ Correct - single allocation
results := make([]Item, 0, len(items))
for _, src := range items {
    results = append(results, transform(src))
}
```

### Use strings.Builder for Concatenation
```go
// ❌ Wrong - O(n²) allocations
var result string
for _, s := range parts {
    result += s
}

// ✅ Correct - O(n)
var b strings.Builder
for _, s := range parts {
    b.WriteString(s)
}
result := b.String()
```

Run `make toolbox-exec ARGS="golangci-lint run"` to catch these with the `prealloc` linter.
