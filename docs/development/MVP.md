## Post-MVP Priorities

1. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search, saved filters
2. **Reporting**: Basic metrics and charts
3. **SLA Management**: Response time tracking
4. **Workflow Automation**: Triggers and actions
5. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI specification
6. **Performance Optimization**: Caching, query optimization
7. **Security Hardening**: Rate limiting, audit logs

## Quick validation

```bash
cp .env.development .env
make up
make test
```

Confirm:

- UI loads at `http://localhost`
- smtp4dev UI loads at `http://localhost:8025`

## Notes

- GOTRS is HTMX-first / server-rendered.
- Local dev is container-first; prefer `make api-call` and other Makefile helpers over host tooling.
