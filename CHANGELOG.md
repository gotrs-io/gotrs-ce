# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project (currently) does not yet use semantic versioning; versions will be tagged once the ticket vertical slice lands.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Generic GoatKit Typeahead enhancement (`goatkit-typeahead.js`): Enter/Tab auto-selects first suggestion, prevents accidental form submission, advances focus.
- GoatKit Autocomplete module (`goatkit-autocomplete.js`): declarative data-attribute driven autocomplete (seed JSON + future remote source), ARIA roles (combobox/listbox/option), keyboard navigation, first-item auto-highlight.
- Visual commit feedback (flash outline) on auto-complete commit.
- Global guards to prevent duplicate script initialization.
- Data seed loader with tolerant JSON parsing (trailing comma removal) and inline `<script type="application/json" data-gk-seed>` support.
- Hidden input synchronization via `data-hidden-target` for canonical value submission.
- Blur + click-outside handling to close suggestion lists.
- Configurable min character threshold (`data-min-chars`, default 1).
- Debug gating via `window.GK_DEBUG` flag (suppressed logs by default).
- Ticket zoom page base template.
- Per-queue ticket stats table (dashboard) and admin dashboard deduplication.
- Redis (Valkey-compatible) caching layer abstraction.
- Article storage backend (DB + filesystem) integration.
- Evidence diff utility for TDD enforcement.
- Unified ticket number generator framework + counter migration.
- Pluggable auth provider registry (database, ldap, static) with tests.
- Dockerfile/dev compose improvements for caching & user customization.
- Comprehensive ticket creation & validation test suite.
- Consolidated schema alignment with Znuny: added `ticket_number_counter`, surrogate primary key for `acl_sync`, `acl_ticket_attribute_relations`, `activity`, `article_color`, `permission_groups`, `translation`, `calendar_appointment_plugin`, `pm_process_preferences`, `smime_keys`, `oauth2_token_config`/`oauth2_token`, and `mention` tables via migration `000001_schema_alignment`.

### Changed
- Refactored customer user inline autocomplete logic on ticket creation form to generic GoatKit modules (removal of large inline JS block in `templates/pages/tickets/new.pongo2`).
- Display template placeholder format switched to single-brace form `{firstName}` to avoid template engine collision; template compiler now supports both `{{key}}` and `{key}`.
- Auth handlers adapted to new provider registry API.
- Ticket creation now relies on repository ticket number generator (post framework introduction).
- Dockerfile optimized for builds (layer caching / user customization notes).
- Activity stream handling cleaned (duplicate handlers removed).
- Added surrogate primary key to `acl_sync` as part of consolidated migration `000001_schema_alignment` to stay aligned with Znuny upstream schema.

### Fixed
- Trailing comma in generated seed JSON causing parse error (replaced incorrect loop variable usage and added tolerant parser).
- Auto-commit path previously populating hidden field with display string instead of login (added `data-login` / `data-value` attributes to suggestion options).
- MutationObserver early attachment errors (guarded until `document.body` present in both typeahead and autocomplete scripts).
- Empty dropdown lingering after selection (added blur close + explicit hide on commit).
- Initial absence of suggestions due to seed load ordering (added pre-load of all seed scripts before initialization).
- Ticket number StartFrom honored via proper counter initialization.
- Premature return in activity stream handler.
- Build handler duplication causing symbol redeclaration.
- Toolbox build/test hanging issues (interactive shell hang & GOFLAGS parsing) resolved.

### Removed
- Unnecessary `console.debug` noise (now gated behind `window.GK_DEBUG`).

### Breaking Changes
- Auth initialization now requires explicit provider registration (auth provider registry).
- New DB migration `000001_schema_alignment` required before further ticket creation.

### Internal / Developer Notes
- Autocomplete registry kept in-memory (`REGISTRY`) for potential future API exposure.
- Future enhancements (not yet implemented): remote data source (`data-source`), match substring highlighting, customizable "No results" template, hot reload of seeds.

- Dark mode + custom Tailwind color palette, dark form element theming.
- Actions dropdown on ticket detail page.
- Rich text editor (Tiptap) integration for ticket/article content.
- Unicode support configuration & filtering.
- Markdown rendering switched to Goldmark with enhanced styling.
- Authentication middleware enhancements (logging, permission service improvements).
- Ticket creation page (HTMX form + error handling) and supporting templates.
- PATH and migration tooling updates for dual Postgres/MySQL dev support.

### Changed
- Refactored authentication middleware & API routes for consistency.
- Updated documentation and Makefile for toolbox workflow & container-first lessons.
- Standardized YAML routing & route loader tooling (static baseline + validation script).

### Fixed
- Permissions issues in admin modules (admin permissions functionality fix).

- Various authentication, routing, ticket functionality issues (multi-fix commit 4a897cb).

### Internal

- HTMX/JS refactors for API calls and utilities consolidation.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-03
### Added
- DB-less fallbacks for lookups, dashboard, tickets, admin pages to keep pages rendering under test / missing DB.
- Deterministic HTMX login path for tests; DB-less ticket creation in `APP_ENV=test`.
- Toolbox targets: staticcheck, curated integration test suites, test harness utilities.
- Storage path env expansion (`STORAGE_PATH`), host network mapping for toolbox, template directory overrides.
- CLI support: auto-create minimal users table & seed (DB-agnostic reset-user), user/admin helpers.
- API routing migration to YAML system completed.

### Changed
- Extensive test hardening & gating (skip when DB unavailable, deterministic outputs).
- Simplified toolbox execution (dropping UID mapping, caching modules/build, SELinux-friendly binds).
- Static analysis integration (staticcheck suppressions + fixes; normalized error strings & context keys).
- Build/runtime Docker & compose improvements (toolchain pinning Go 1.24.6, caching).

### Fixed
- Numerous nil DB panics across handlers/services (graceful fallbacks & guards).
- MariaDB-safe tests & placeholder corrections.
- Lookup handlers defensive defaults (queues/priorities/statuses) when DB absent.
- Test flakiness (shortened DB pings, guarded migrations, removal of unstable skips).
- Integration test compilation errors & unused symbol issues.

### Internal
- Separation of archived/ignored handlers via `//go:build ignore`.
- Normalization of Make targets (whitespace/tab fixes, GOFLAGS enforcement).
- Added curated test tags (integration, debug-only).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-17
